## Automated Security Scanning

As part of its early-stage security practices, the Netlink smart contract has been reviewed using widely recognized automated third-party security scanners. These tools are commonly used across the Web3 ecosystem to provide quick assessments of deployed contracts and highlight potential risk indicators.

The results below reflect the publicly available scan outcomes at the time this documentation was prepared.

| Scanner | Result Summary |
|-------|----------------|
| **GoPlus Security** | Risky Items: **0**<br/>No critical or high-risk indicators were flagged by the automated analysis. |
| **SolidityScan (QuickScan)** | Overall Score: **94.64 (Great)**<br/>Strong automated assessment based on common vulnerability checks. |

### Scope and Limitations

Automated security scanners are designed to detect common issues and known risk patterns. They do not replace comprehensive manual audits performed by specialized security firms.

The information presented here is provided for transparency and reference purposes only and should not be interpreted as a guarantee of security.

### Manual Review and Future Audits

In addition to automated security scanning, Netlink recognizes the importance of manual code review as part of a comprehensive security strategy. Manual reviews provide deeper analysis that cannot be fully captured by automated tools alone.

As the ecosystem evolves and additional utilities are introduced, the Netlink team intends to pursue further security reviews or third-party audits when appropriate. This phased approach allows security efforts to align with actual system complexity and usage rather than treating audits as a one-time checkbox.

Any completed manual reviews or external audits will be transparently disclosed and referenced in this documentation.
