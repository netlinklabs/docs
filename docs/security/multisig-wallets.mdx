Netlink uses multisignature (multisig) wallets to secure major token allocations and ensure that critical funds are managed through collective authorization rather than individual control.

Multisig wallets require approval from multiple authorized signers before any transaction can be executed. This approach reduces single-point-of-failure risks and reinforces transparency, accountability, and long-term alignment across the Netlink ecosystem.

At the time this documentation was prepared, approximately **62.04% of the total NET supply** is locked via PinkLock, reflecting a commitment to controlled distribution and ecosystem stability.

## Transparency and Verification

All multisig activity and token locks are recorded on the Polygon blockchain and can be independently verified through public explorers and PinkLock references.

Netlink intentionally publishes only multisig wallets representing collective decision-making and systemic risk. Personal or operational EOA wallets are not disclosed to protect security and operational integrity.

For additional context on allocations and distribution principles, please refer to the **Tokenomics** section of this documentation.
