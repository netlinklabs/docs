## Security Overview

Security is a foundational principle of the Netlink ecosystem. Netlink is designed with a focus on transparency, risk awareness, and responsible use of blockchain technology rather than reliance on centralized trust.

While no blockchain system can be entirely risk-free, Netlink adopts practical security measures to reduce common risks and align long-term incentives between the project, its contributors, and the community.

## Design Principles

Netlink’s security approach is guided by several core principles:

- **Transparency by Design**  
  All token transactions and allocations are recorded on-chain and can be independently verified through public blockchain explorers.

- **Minimized Single-Point-of-Failure**  
  Critical token allocations are secured using multisignature wallets, ensuring that no single individual can unilaterally control sensitive funds.

- **Standardized Infrastructure**  
  NET follows the ERC-20 token standard and is deployed on the Polygon network, benefiting from widely adopted tooling and ecosystem support.

- **Progressive Disclosure**  
  Sensitive operational details are intentionally limited in public documentation, while essential trust-related information is openly shared.

## Multisignature Wallets

Netlink uses multisignature (multisig) wallets to secure key allocations such as treasury, development, community, and team reserves. This structure requires collective authorization for transactions and significantly reduces risks associated with key compromise or unilateral actions.

Detailed information about published multisig wallets can be found on the **Multisignature Wallets** page.

## Token Locking and Distribution Control

A significant portion of the NET supply is locked through third-party locking mechanisms. Token locking helps prevent sudden supply changes and demonstrates long-term commitment to the ecosystem’s stability.

Locking details, where applicable, are publicly verifiable and referenced through official documentation.

## Ongoing Security Considerations

Security is not a one-time implementation but an ongoing process. As the Netlink ecosystem evolves, security practices may be reviewed and improved in response to new use cases, infrastructure changes, or community feedback.

Where appropriate, external reviews or audits may be conducted to further strengthen trust and resilience.

## Shared Responsibility

Participation in the Netlink ecosystem involves shared responsibility. Users are encouraged to exercise caution, verify information independently, and use reputable wallets and platforms when interacting with NET.

Netlink does not assume custodial responsibility for user assets, and all interactions with the blockchain are executed at the user’s discretion.

## Team Transparency and Identity

In addition to on-chain transparency, Netlink emphasizes accountability at the team level. Core contributors associated with the Netlink project are publicly referenced through professional profiles linked on the official website.

These profiles, including LinkedIn references, are intended to provide verifiable context regarding the individuals involved in building and maintaining the Netlink ecosystem. Where applicable, such references may also be used as part of third-party verification or KYC processes.

This approach reflects Netlink’s commitment to being built by identifiable and accountable individuals, while maintaining appropriate boundaries around personal data and operational security.
