## About Netlink

Netlink (NET) is a community-driven digital asset built on the Polygon network. NET is designed as a utility token that can be used to support ideas, build communities, reward contributors, and foster collaboration across various projects.

With a vision to become a global community support token, NET enables anyone to participate in blockchain innovation without being burdened by technical complexity.

## A Different Approach to Web3

Unlike many crypto projects that are created primarily for speculation or purely financial purposes, NET takes a different approach.

Netlink was designed as a **collective support token** — a way for people to show tangible support, validate early ideas, and strengthen communities in both online and offline contexts.

Rather than focusing on short-term price movements, NET emphasizes long-term utility, participation, and collaboration.

## Built on Polygon

By leveraging Polygon’s fast and low-cost infrastructure, NET ensures accessibility for everyone while remaining compatible with a wide range of decentralized applications.

This allows NET to integrate seamlessly into:
- Community platforms  
- Creative and open-source projects  
- Games and digital experiences  
- Future Web3 utilities  

Polygon’s scalability makes NET practical for real-world use, not just experimentation.

## Long-Term Vision
