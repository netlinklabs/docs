## Current Development Phase

At the current stage of development, the Netlink Mini App is designed as a foundational application. While its practical functionality is intentionally limited, the application plays an important role in establishing the core interaction layer of the Netlink ecosystem.

This early version allows the Netlink team to observe real usage, validate assumptions, and conduct iterative research and development in a controlled and transparent manner.

## Looking Ahead

Over time, the Netlink Mini App is expected to evolve into a central hub for community interaction within the ecosystem. As additional features are introduced, the application may support broader participation, coordination, and utility for both individual users and communities.

Any expansion of functionality will be guided by real usage patterns and documented transparently as part of the ongoing development process.
