## Getting Started with the Mini App

The Netlink Mini App (Beta) can be accessed using a desktop, laptop, or smartphone through a modern web browser.

## Accessing the Application

- Open the Netlink Mini App using a desktop, laptop, or mobile device  
- If using a desktop or laptop, ensure a compatible Web3 wallet extension is installed  
- Click the **Connect Wallet** button to begin  

## Wallet Connection

Once a wallet is successfully connected, the application will display an overview of balances associated with the connected address.

## Balance Overview

The Mini App currently displays three primary balances:

- **NET Balance**  
  Represents the Netlink Token held in the connected wallet

- **Polygon (POL) Balance**  
  Used to cover network transaction fees when sending NET on the Polygon network

- **USDC Balance**  
  Displays the stablecoin balance available on the Polygon network

## Network Requirement

Users should ensure that their wallet is connected to the **Polygon PoS network** to interact correctly with the Netlink Mini App.

## Transaction History

At the bottom of the interface, the Mini App displays the **10 most recent NET transactions**, allowing users to quickly review recent activity associated with their wallet.

## Feature Availability and Updates

Some features within the Netlink Mini App may still be under development. As new features are introduced, they will become available automatically through the application without requiring additional setup from users.

Guides and explanations for newly released features will be documented and updated continuously within this documentation to ensure clarity and transparency.
