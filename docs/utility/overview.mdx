## Utility Overview

In the Netlink ecosystem, utility is defined by participation rather than speculation. Netlink Token (NET) is designed to function as a practical tool that enables communities, contributors, and supporters to interact, collaborate, and coordinate in a transparent way.

Rather than positioning utility as a single feature, Netlink approaches utility as a layered concept that evolves alongside real usage and community needs.

## Utility as Participation

NET is intended to be used as a medium of participation. Holding or using NET represents engagement with ideas, communities, and initiatives rather than passive ownership.

This participation-first approach allows NET to support activities such as signaling support, validating early ideas, rewarding contributions, and enabling access to community-driven utilities.

## Practical and Reusable Utility

Netlink focuses on utilities that encourage repeated and meaningful interactions. Instead of one-time actions, NET is designed to support ongoing participation across different contexts, including digital communities, collaborative projects, and future Web3 applications.

This emphasis on repeatable utility helps align token usage with long-term ecosystem growth.

## Simplicity and Accessibility

Utility within Netlink is designed to remain accessible to users with varying levels of technical experience. By leveraging low-cost blockchain infrastructure and standardized token mechanics, NET enables interaction without introducing unnecessary complexity.

The goal is to make token usage feel intuitive and aligned with everyday digital behavior rather than requiring deep technical knowledge.

## An Evolving Utility Model

The utility of NET is not static. As the Netlink ecosystem grows, new applications and integrations may emerge organically based on community demand and real-world use cases.

This documentation reflects the current understanding of NET’s utility while allowing room for gradual expansion and iteration without compromising core principles.
