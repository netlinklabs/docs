## What Is the Netlink Token (NET)?

Netlink Token (NET) is a community-driven utility token built on the Polygon blockchain. NET is designed to support communities, ideas, and collaborative initiatives by enabling transparent participation, contribution, and coordination across different projects and platforms.

Rather than serving as a purely speculative asset, NET functions as a utility token within the Netlink ecosystem, where its primary role is to facilitate support, validation, and engagement.

## Token Overview

- **Token Name:** Netlink Token  
- **Symbol:** NET  
- **Blockchain Network:** Polygon  
- **Token Standard:** ERC-20  
- **Total Supply:** 99,000,000 NET  
- **Decimals:** 18  

The use of 18 decimals follows the ERC-20 standard and ensures compatibility with widely used wallets, tools, and decentralized applications across the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Network and Infrastructure

NET is deployed on the Polygon network, which is fully compatible with Ethereum. This allows NET to leverage Ethereum’s established tooling and security model while benefiting from Polygon’s low transaction costs and fast confirmation times.

This infrastructure choice supports Netlink’s goal of accessibility, making it easier for communities and individuals to interact with the token without facing high fees or technical barriers.

## Smart Contract Information

- **Contract Address:**  
  `0x0e893B239094A5c573373d44CF1C7D03576b95cb`

The smart contract follows the ERC-20 standard and is publicly verifiable on Polygon-compatible blockchain explorers. All token transfers and interactions are recorded on-chain and can be independently audited.

## Token Transparency

Every NET transaction is permanently recorded on the Polygon blockchain. This ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability across the ecosystem, allowing participants to verify activity without relying on centralized intermediaries.

## Wallet and Application Compatibility

As an ERC-20 token on Polygon, NET is compatible with a wide range of non-custodial wallets, decentralized applications, and Web3 tools that support the Polygon network. This enables seamless integration into community platforms, applications, and future utilities within the Netlink ecosystem.

## Recommended Network Configuration (Advanced Users)

For users interacting directly with the Polygon network through custom RPC settings, the following configuration may be used:

- **Network Name:** Polygon Mainnet  
- **RPC URL:** https://polygon-rpc.com  
- **Chain ID:** 137  
- **Currency Symbol:** POL  
- **Block Explorer:** https://polygonscan.com  

This configuration is optional and intended for users who require manual network setup.

## Purpose Within the Ecosystem

The Netlink Token is designed to act as a shared utility layer across the ecosystem. Its role is to support participation, collaboration, and community-driven initiatives rather than to function as a standalone financial instrument.

Further details on how NET is used in practice can be found in the Utility and Use Case sections of this documentation.
