## Built on the Polygon Network

Netlink (NET) is deployed on the Polygon network, a widely adopted blockchain infrastructure designed to provide scalability, low transaction costs, and fast confirmation times.

Polygon is fully compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing NET to benefit from Ethereum’s security model while offering a more accessible and efficient user experience.

## Why Polygon?

The decision to build Netlink on Polygon is driven by practical considerations that align with Netlink’s community-first philosophy.

- **Low Transaction Costs**  
  Polygon enables affordable on-chain interactions, making participation accessible to a wider audience without high fees.

- **Fast Transaction Finality**  
  Transactions are confirmed quickly, allowing smooth and responsive interactions for everyday use cases.

- **Ethereum Compatibility**  
  As an Ethereum-compatible network, Polygon supports standard tools, wallets, and decentralized applications.

- **Proven Ecosystem**  
  Polygon is supported by a large developer community and a mature ecosystem of infrastructure and applications.

## Accessibility and User Experience

By leveraging Polygon, Netlink reduces friction for users who may be new to blockchain technology. Lower fees and faster transactions make it easier for communities, founders, and members to interact with NET without being constrained by technical or financial barriers.

This infrastructure choice supports Netlink’s goal of making blockchain participation feel intuitive and practical rather than complex or exclusive.

## Network Transparency

All NET transactions are recorded on the Polygon blockchain and can be independently verified through public blockchain explorers. This ensures transparency, auditability, and trust across the Netlink ecosystem.
