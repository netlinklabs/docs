## Tokenomics Overview

The tokenomics of Netlink Token (NET) is designed to balance community growth, ecosystem development, and long-term sustainability. The allocation structure reflects Netlink’s community-first approach while ensuring sufficient resources for ongoing development and operational needs.

**Total Supply:** 99,000,000 NET

## Token Allocation

- **Community:** 30%  
- **Public & Private Sales:** 25%  
- **Development:** 15%  
- **Treasury:** 10%  
- **Founder & Team:** 15%  
- **Investor:** 5%  

This allocation is intended to support broad community participation while maintaining flexibility for development, partnerships, and ecosystem growth.

## Token Locking and Transparency

At the time this documentation was prepared, the Netlink team has locked a total of **61,425,000 NET**, representing approximately **62.04% of the total supply**, through the PinkSale platform.

Token locking is implemented to demonstrate long-term commitment, reduce immediate circulating supply pressure, and align the interests of the team, contributors, and the community.

## Commitment to Transparency

Transparency is a core principle of the Netlink ecosystem. To support this, Netlink publicly discloses key wallet structures used for token management.

Details regarding secured and multi-signature wallet arrangements can be found on the **Multisignature Wallets** page:

This page provides additional information on how critical funds are safeguarded and managed to enhance trust and accountability.

## Long-Term Perspective

The Netlink tokenomics model is designed to evolve alongside the ecosystem. While allocations and locking mechanisms are established to ensure stability, future adjustments may occur as the project matures and community participation grows.

Any significant changes will be communicated transparently through official documentation and channels.
