## How to Acquire NET

At this stage, Netlink Token (NET) is not yet available for open market trading on decentralized exchanges (DEX). NET is currently distributed through a staged presale process prior to its official DEX launch.

The Netlink team plans to conduct up to three presale phases before NET becomes available on decentralized markets. These presale phases are designed to support early community participation and gradual ecosystem development.

Please note that timelines and structures may evolve as the project progresses. Adjustments may occur if development milestones are reached earlier than expected or if strategic considerations require changes.

## Presale Phase 1 (Current)

Presale Phase 1 is currently conducted through the PinkSale platform on the Polygon network.

Participants can acquire NET during this phase via the official PinkSale launchpad:

This presale phase is scheduled to run until **December 31**, unless updated by the project team.

## Future Presale Phases

Additional presale phases (Phase 2 and Phase 3) are planned prior to the official DEX launch. Details regarding these phases — including timing, structure, and availability — will be announced through:

- This documentation page  
- The official Netlink website  

Community members are encouraged to rely only on official Netlink communication channels for updates.

## Important Notice

NET is currently distributed only through official presale mechanisms. It is not yet available for swapping on decentralized exchanges.

Participants should always verify contract addresses and links before interacting with any third-party platforms. Netlink does not provide financial or investment advice, and participation in presale phases should be undertaken with appropriate consideration and risk awareness.

Further information regarding NET distribution, utilities, and future availability can be found throughout this documentation.
