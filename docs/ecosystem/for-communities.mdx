## Building Real Support with Netlink

Netlink (NET) is designed to help communities grow stronger through collective participation and transparent support. By leveraging token-based collaboration, communities can demonstrate solidarity, build sustainable ecosystems, and encourage broader participation from both existing members and new supporters.

Rather than relying solely on informal signals of engagement, NET enables communities to express support in a tangible and verifiable way, recorded directly on the blockchain.

## How Netlink Supports Communities

- **Tangible Support**  
  Provide a clear and verifiable form of support that is recorded on-chain

- **Credibility and Visibility**  
  Help communities establish credibility and trust in the public eye through transparent participation

- **Community Funding**  
  Serve as an initial fundraising mechanism for community-led activities and initiatives

## Strengthening Community Solidarity

Netlink is intended to function as a practical tool for strengthening solidarity within communities. By aligning participation with transparent and decentralized support, NET helps communities organize, grow, and collaborate more effectively.

The goal is not to replace existing community platforms, but to complement them with a simple layer of blockchain-based support that reinforces trust and collective commitment.
